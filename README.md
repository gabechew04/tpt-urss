# About this repository:
CURRENTLY STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION
This repository is part of the 2025 URSS project by Gabriel Chew that was submitted to the University of Warwick.
It contains the code files used to compute quantities from finite, discrete-time transition path theory. It also contains the notebooks used in creating visualisations to demonstrate the concepts in transition path theory.
